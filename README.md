**VehiChain** stands as a pioneering decentralized system tailored for streamlined vehicle management, ensuring both efficiency and transparency in the vehicle supply chain.

💫 Functionality Overview

-The journey starts at the foundational stage: the manufacturer's registration of a new vehicle. Once the vehicle is launched into the market, it's acquired by a retailer at a set price. Subsequently, a consumer can buy this vehicle from the said retailer. Every step of this process is meticulously documented on the blockchain, ensuring unparalleled transparency in the vehicle's journey.

-Users gain access to a comprehensive vehicle history, tracing its path right from its manufacturing stage. This not only enhances transparency but also acts as a deterrent against the influx of fake vehicles in the market. Such a feature is invaluable, especially when considering high-end branded vehicles or even medicinal products.

-Financial transactions are facilitated through the Ethereum blockchain network, adding an extra layer of security and trust to the trading process.

-By digitizing the entire supply chain management, VehiChain ensures seamless and efficient operational and logistical processes.
